This project is an interactive Streamlit application designed to explore nuclear bomb detonations that occurred worldwide before the year 2000.
It uses a detailed dataset to present information about these detonations, including their locations, yields, source countries, and purposes.
The app provides a user-friendly interface with multiple tabs that allow users to interact with the data in various ways.
Users can view a global map of detonation sites, analyze trends over time, and examine statistics like explosion yields and detonation reasons.
The application integrates visualizations such as maps, pie charts, and bar charts to make the data more engaging and insightful.
By combining filters and dynamic tools, the project offers an accessible way to investigate patterns and details behind nuclear detonations historically.
